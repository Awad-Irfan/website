        Some Penn Labs products that you may be familiar with include Penn Course
        Review, Penn Mobile, and Penn Course Alert. Weâ€™ve had more than 100,000
        total users of our products. Through the Common Funding Application we
        build and maintain, we've helped processed over $930,000 in grants for
        student organizations.

      <P>
        Our mission is to build tech products to serve all Penn students, and we
        recognize that goal requires a decent amount of commitment and technical
        experience. We meet for 4 hours each week to work on projects, discuss
        future product roadmaps, and learn more about the technologies we use.
        Members are also expected to work outside of meetings to meet product
        goals. While technical ability varies when joining Penn Labs and our
        members are always learning, our commitment to building quality products
        means that we seek candidates with sufficient technical ability, which we
        evaluate through the technical challenge phase of the application process.
